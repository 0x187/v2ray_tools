# What is this?
Bunch of bash scripts to help you manage your v2ray server.

# What does it do?
To elaborate:
- Add, view, delete users to/from your config file
- Assign number of devices a user can use 
- Tells you if a user exceeds the assigned number of devices (by checking the logs and IP addresses)
- Supports servers that are load balanced
# How do I use it?

It's not a program. It's just a bunch of bash scripts. YOU NEED TO READ EVERY FILE IN THIS REPOSITORY BEFORE RUNNING THEM ON YOUR SERVER. Check what argument each script takes and run them accordingly. Do not expect a plug-and-play experience. I didn't have time to make a manual page or a help message for each script. They're all simple enough to understand even as a new-bie.
TL;DR: Learn how to use it by reading it.
